                            <p>A dream for every science student is to be in IITs. It happened to me in 2016 to do Masters. It was a great experience to learn from the best institute faculty.
                                The major subject of my degree was VLSI, where I got to learn about nano-technology, using different softwares to develop these ICs using Verilog Language. One of it was 
                                XILINX. My projects was based on the MOSFET, to use different materials to study the cracks that get produced in it. The topic of my Project was: "Study and comparison of crack and its variation in GaN, GaAs and InP based MOSFET"

                    <p>Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University, Bareilly | 2015</p>
                    <p>Started my first professional education in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Gained knowledge on different subjects
                        like Embedded Systems, Digital and Analog Electronics as being my favorites. During my graduation year, I have done many other courses like 
                        Robotics and MatLab from CETPA, Embedded Systems from OraneLabs Pvt Ltd. IIT Kanpur. Participated in other activities like AECE-14 National Conference,
                        Volunteered as Technical Head in National Conference in designing ID cards, Certificates, managing all technical elements. Also, published and set-up departmental booklet with support to all other members.
                        In the Final year presented my project Thesis on: "Power Control Algorithm in CDMA"

                            Then,comparison is made to see which material is best suited for manufacturing as per the crack aspects for MOSFET device.</p>
